## CSGO AimRadar  

Just a little project for fun and bucket list kind of thing.  
Read more about it [here](https://djnedrelid.github.io/trig-illustrasjon/).  

Strongly outdated now by about a year, but should/could work with updated offsets. 
I used offsets from a hazedump back when I made it. 
It's an external window that lays over the game and uses GDI for radar and aim lock 
activated by mbutton5 (left back navigation button). It snaps to heads when within a 
9 degree cone/angle. See the link above for a JavaScript example.  

Maybe some of the code can work as a helpful reference to someone else starting out.
